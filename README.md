🔧 Getting Started

For Developers

```python
# Basic CPOS API Usage
from corona import TrinityAI, EagleEye, SwarmIntelligence

# Initialize Trinity AI
trinity = TrinityAI(
    quantum_backend="ibm_quantum",
    mode="pandemic_response"
)

# Predict outbreak risk
risk = trinity.predictive.assess_outbreak_risk(
    location="coordinates",
    timeframe="30d"
)

# Use swarm intelligence for decision making
swarm = SwarmIntelligence()
decision = swarm.crow.collective_decide(risk)
```

For Health Organizations

```bash
# Deploy regional health monitoring
cpos-cli deploy --type=regional --country=Japan --capacity=10M

# Monitor local health status
cpos-cli health status --region=Kanto --detailed

# Run outbreak simulation
cpos-cli simulate outbreak --virus=novel_coronavirus --r0=3.5
```

For Researchers

```python
# Access quantum drug discovery
from corona.quantum import DrugDiscovery

discovery = DrugDiscovery()
candidates = discovery.screen_compounds(
    target="SARS-CoV-2_spike_protein",
    library_size=1000000,
    method="quantum_docking"
)

# Use quantum neural networks for pattern recognition
from corona.neuromorphic import QuantumSNN

qsnn = QuantumSNN()
patterns = qsnn.analyze_health_patterns(
    data_stream=eagle_eye.get_stream(),
    anomaly_threshold=0.95
)
```
